Subject: [TAP-announce] TAP toolchain 1.1
Message-ID: <4337E813.9060107@urbanec.net>

Thanks to some great work done by Steve Bennett, we now have a toolchain 
available for creating TAPs.

The latest release is 1.1 and includes both source code and built 
binaries for GNU/Linux x86, Windows/Cygwin x86 and Mac/OSX PPC.

Please see the files section at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/tap/

Subject: [TAP-announce] TAP Project gets a new home page.
Message-ID: <433EAFE1.9030801@urbanec.net>

The TAP project just received a new home page. The new page should make 
it easier to find relevant information. The new project page is a lot 
simpler than the project summary page and contains links to all the 
important resources.

Please use the above URL when referring to the project.

Subject: [TAP-announce] Project documentation updated.
Message-ID: <4342713C.3060308@urbanec.net>

The project page documentation link now points to a new section that 
includes two step-by-step guides.

Part one covers Cygwin installation and setup.

Part two provides instructions for setting up the workspace, retrieving 
the latest source code, building TAPs and making use of the automated 
build infrastructure for your own TAP projects.
